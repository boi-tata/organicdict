# OrganicDict
OrganicDict is a Python object that's implements dict built-in type, adding some useful features.
## Origin
Its has projected initially as a function, to be used in some specific situations where is usefull convert a sequence of sequences, like SQL queries results, in `dict` objects, for better organization and easier access to data.
But is easy to fall on a situation where needs a `dict` with 4 or more levels of depth, thats not so easy to deal with. Here is when the idea of transform this function to a object appeared.
